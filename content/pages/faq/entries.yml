  - question: 'What do "Tiny Porch Concerts" look like? Can I see pictures? '
    answer: >-
      It looks like neighbors connecting with one another. I looks like
      neighbors walking/biking/pushing strollers around Woodland Heights. It
      looks like budding artists trying out their skills, or established artists
      sharing their talents with all.

  - question: "How do I get to Tiny Porch? "
    answer: >-
      This is a pedestrian friendly event for the neighbors (or wannabe
      neighbors) of Woodland Heights. Please walk or bike between Host Porches
      during our Sunday evening concerts. 


      If you are coming from somewhere not walkable, please use Richmond's public transit system -- there are very close bus stops to ALL our Host Porches. 


      Simply add in the address that you're coming from and the Host Porch you're headed to to listen to music and GRTC will give you a direct route: <https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/>


      [](https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/)Another option is to take [RVA Bikes ](https://rvabikes.com/map)- there is a convenient docking location in Carter Jones Park. [](https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/)
  - question: "Are porta-potties available? "
    answer: >-
      No, this is a neighborhood pedestrian/cyclist friendly event, neighbors
      are urged to walk back to their own homes to use the restrooms. This is an
      outdoor event, no music will be playing in homes or in fenced yards so
      there is no need for Host Porches to open the inside of thier homes. 


      HOST PORCHES WILL NOT HAVE THE INTERIOR OF THEIR HOMES OPEN, Please do not ask a Host Porch to use their restroom.
  - question: "There's a new neighbor on my block, how do I invite them? "
    answer: >-
      The Tiny Porch Planning Committee has created a resource to support you in
      inviting out new neighbors or anyone you don't yet know on your block!
      Thereâ€™s tons of research that backs up the benefits of knowing your
      neighbors for improved physical and mental health, increased safety, and
      overall community wellbeing.
