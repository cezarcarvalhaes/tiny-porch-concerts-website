  - question: 'What do "Tiny Porch Concerts" look like? Can I see pictures? '
    answer: >-
      It looks like neighbors connecting with one another. I looks like
      neighbors walking/biking/pushing strollers around Woodland Heights. It
      looks like budding artists trying out their skills, or established artists
      sharing their talents with all.

  - question: "How do I get to Tiny Porch? "
    answer: >-
      This is a pedestrian friendly event for the neighbors (or wannabe
      neighbors) of Woodland Heights. Please walk or bike between Host Porches
      during our Sunday evening concerts. 


      If you are coming from somewhere not walkable, please use Richmond's public transit system -- there are very close bus stops to ALL our Host Porches. 


      Simply add in the address that you're coming from and the Host Porch you're headed to to listen to music and GRTC will give you a direct route: <https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/>
