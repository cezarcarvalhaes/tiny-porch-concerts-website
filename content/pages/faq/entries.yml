  - question: What is the Tiny Porch Concert Series?
    answer: The Tiny Porch Concert Series is a series of concerts that take place on
      the porches/stoops/front yards of homes in the Woodland Heights
      neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia. The series is a celebration of local
      music, food, and community.
  - question: When do the concerts take place?
    answer: The concerts take place one Sunday of each month from June to October.
  - question: Who can attend the concerts?
    answer: >-
      The concerts are free and open to the public. All are welcome to attend.




      Please be mindful that this is a neighborhood event, so while we always welcome the greater Richmond community we don't advocate for additional car traffic or parking. Please take non-car transportation if joining from outside Woodland Heights. There are several [GRTC stops](https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/) in the neighborhood as well as [RVA Bikes](https://rvabikes.com/map).
  - question: "How do I get to Tiny Porch? Where do I park? "
    answer: >-
      This is a pedestrian friendly event for the neighbors (or wannabe
      neighbors) of Woodland Heights. Please walk or bike between Host Porches
      during our Sunday evening concerts. 


      If you are coming from somewhere not walkable, please use Richmond's public transit system -- there are very close bus stops to ALL our Host Porches. We are not advocating for additional vehicular traffic in the neighborhood during these events. 


      Simply add in the address that you're coming from and the Host Porch you're headed to to listen to music and GRTC will give you a direct route: <https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/>


      [](https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/)Another option is to take [RVA Bikes ](https://rvabikes.com/map)- there is a convenient docking location in Carter Jones Park. [](https://ridegrtc.com/planning-your-trip/trip-planner/)
  - question: "Is it encouraged to bring chairs and/or blankets? "
    answer: Keep in mind that this is a pedestrian friendly event where neighbors
      will be walking on public streets to connect with one another and enjoy
      music from budding artists. You will be on public streets and should be
      aware and attend to any vehicular traffic for the safety of all neighbors
      enjoying the music.
  - question: "Can I bring food and drink? "
    answer: >-
      You'll be walking around public streets - so anything that you'd typically
      carry with you on a walk around the neighborhood, feel free to do so. 


      [Please respect all of Richmond, Virginia's established laws. ](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title4.1/chapter3/#:~:text=%C2%A7%204.1%2D308.,of%20a%20Class%204%20misdemeanor.)
  - question: "Can I set up a table and sell things? "
    answer: >-
      
      The mission statement of Tiny Porch guides all of our work, with the ultimate goal of bringing neighbors out of their homes to walk or bike the beautiful streets of Woodland Heights, connect with one another, and support local Richmond musicians. The neighborhood already offers many opportunities to sell goods, such as the Sunday South of the James Farmer’s Market and nearby Maker’s Markets. We never want to take the focus away from the artists donating their time (so please be sure to tip!) or from the authentic connections formed when neighbors come together. While we’d love to support your work at an alternative neighborhood event, it’s simply not the vision of Tiny Porch.
  - question: Where do the concerts take place?
    answer: >-
      The concerts take place on the porches/stoops/front yards of homes in the
      Woodland Heights neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia.

  - question: "What happens if it's raining? What's the cancellation of Tiny Porch
      policy due to weather? "
    answer: >-
      **Cancellation Notification:** Any cancellation of a scheduled Tiny Porch
      event due to weather will be announced on Woodland Heights' Facebook and
      Instagram pages by TWO HOURS prior to the start of Tiny Porch on the event
      day.


      **Weather Criteria for Cancellation:** Events will be canceled in case of:


      * Thunder and lightning

      * More than a drizzle

      * Official heat advisory declared by the city/state


      **Rescheduling for Musicians:** Musicians impacted by cancellations will have priority for the last concert date in October (October 19th, if they choose). October scheduling is held until October 1st for flexibility.


      **Host Porch Schedule:** Host porches are pre-assigned and won't be rescheduled.
  - question: 'What do "Tiny Porch Concerts" look like? Can I see pictures? '
    answer: >-
      It looks like neighbors connecting with one another. I looks like
      neighbors walking/biking/pushing strollers around Woodland Heights. It
      looks like budding artists trying out their skills, or established artists
      sharing their talents with all.

      The Tiny Porch Planning Committee has created a resource to support you in
      inviting out new neighbors or anyone you don't yet know on your block!
      There’s tons of research that backs up the benefits of knowing your
      neighbors for improved physical and mental health, increased safety, and
      overall community wellbeing.


      [Check out this video overview of how to use this resource.](https://www.loom.com/share/b5544c1da4f1433682a1482800b568ed?sid=9082cd5b-0b25-4bb0-af66-b1faadb7d5e6)

      Remember - personal invites go a LONG way to building connection + community.
  - question: "Are porta-potties available? "
    answer: >-
      No, this is a neighborhood pedestrian/cyclist friendly event, neighbors
      are urged to walk back to their own homes to use the restrooms. This is an
      outdoor event, no music will be playing in homes or in fenced yards so
      there is no need for Host Porches to open the inside of their homes. 


      HOST PORCHES WILL NOT HAVE THE INTERIOR OF THEIR HOMES OPEN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, Please do not ask a Host Porch to use their restroom.
  - question: "While walking around Woodland Heights during a Tiny Porch Concert I
      noticed an infrastructure and/or neighborhood fix that I would like

  - question: I don't live in Woodland Heights, but live nearby, why can't I be a
      "Host Porch"?
    answer: >-
      
      Part of the vision and mission of Woodland Heights’ Tiny Porch is to ensure a walkable, pedestrian-friendly event for all neighbors. For this reason, all Host Porches are located within the roughly one-square-mile area of the [Woodland Heights neighborhood.](https://rva.gov/planning-development-review/civic-groups?fbclid=IwY2xjawO2LddleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFCeGM2MGRKSlBrNU4ySDRlc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHmcXs9JJHQqeq63Vt9gXfEoRFgtc8Vtz-TnX3ZmTFJxCAe-bTTtEhftEASG__aem_E9oAc5D2fTvUh5v0MClbSg) While everyone is welcome to bike, stroll, or wander over to enjoy the music and camaraderie, setting this boundary allows Tiny Porch to preserve its unique, neighborhood feel and uphold its commitment to being a pedestrian-friendly event.


      We live in an absolutely amazing city, full of special neighborhoods and incredible community events to explore. If you feel your neighborhood would benefit from an event like Tiny Porch, we encourage you to start attending Planning Meetings to shadow the process—and then put your own unique spin on it! Bellevue has Porchella, Forest Hill hosts Music in the Park, Spring Hill has a Hootenanny, Churchill brings the Bellwether, and Fulton features East by East End. Be sure to support these (and many more) wonderful, community-driven events throughout the city.
