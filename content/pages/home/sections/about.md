title: What is Tiny Porch?
---

The Woodland Heights Tiny Porch Concert Series represents a grassroots community effort initiated by a dedicated group of neighbors in spring 2023.

Held on Sunday evenings, the event revolves around three "host porches," each featuring two sets of musical performances throughout the evening. This deliberate organization ensures that Woodland Heights' residents, whether long-time locals or recent newcomers, can enjoy a relaxed and regular opportunity to explore the charming streets of our wonderful neighborhood. These outdoor Sunday events offer a chance for Woodland Heights residents, as well as those from nearby neighborhoods within walking distance, to come together, share smiles, engage in conversations, and relish in the music of local, diverse Richmond artists.

As the years progress, the Woodland Heights Tiny Porch Concert series will continue to forge connections among new and established neighbors, fostering stronger bonds within the community.

Featuring 3 Host Porches, 6 incredible groups of performers, and promising an evening filled with neighborhood camaraderie, this event embodies the spirit of unity and togetherness.
