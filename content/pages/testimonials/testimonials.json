      "text": "The tiny porch series is such a unique and exciting way for artists to showcase their talent and for fans to experience the music. Because of its ‘block party’ feel, the fans and artists are together on the same plane and able to interact and share the experience in a way that doesn’t happen on a stage in a club. The hosts are amazing and warm. The whole neighborhood is engaged and the feeling of community and love is absolutely palpable. If you have the chance to play or attend in some way, don’t pass it up.",

We felt welcomed and appreciated. Y'all went above and beyond to promote and share our art. Y'all made sure we had the right equipment and helped us load in and out. We'd love to play there again!",
